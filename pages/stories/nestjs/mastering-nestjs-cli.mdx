# Mastering NestJS CLI

Welcome to my NestJS Series! let's  dive into a key part of modern project development: automation.

Just like any project, Nest projects benefit from automation. That's why Nest provides a helpful tool called Nest CLI, found in the `@nestjs/cli` package. This tool makes tasks like setting up projects, compiling, and automatically watching for file changes a breeze.

In this part of our series, "Mastering NestCLI" we'll learn all about Nest CLI and how it can supercharge our development process. Let's get started!

### Installing Nest CLI and Commonly Used Commands

You can easily install `@nestjs/cli` and access its commonly used commands.

To get started, you can execute it directly using npx, which will download it and then run it:

```bash
npx @nestjs/cli new <project-name>
```
Alternatively, you can install it globally and then execute it. This method is more recommended:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli

nest new <project-name>
```

However, keep in mind that you may need to periodically update the CLI to ensure you're using the latest version:

```bash
npm update -g @nestjs/cli
```

Now, let's explore some of the commands provided by Nest CLI. You can see a list of available commands by running:

```bash
nest -h
```

![nest -h](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/1.png)

let's break down each command:


### Creating a New Project: nest new

The nest new command is used to create a new NestJS project. It initializes a new project with the necessary files and configurations to get started. It comes with several options:

![nest new -h](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/2.png)

- `--skip-git` and `--skip-install` are easy to understand; they skip the initialization of Git and skip the npm install step.
- `--package-manager` specifies the package manager to use. Previously, when creating a project, we were asked to choose:

![nest new package manager](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/3.png)

Once specified, it skips the package manager selection step:

![nest new package manager](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/4.png)

- `--language` allows you to specify TypeScript or JavaScript. Generally, we choose TypeScript, so it's fine to stick with the default.
- `--strict` specifies whether strict mode is enabled for TypeScript compilation. There are five options:

![tsconfig.json](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/5.png)

The default is false, but you can also specify true.

### Generating Code: nest generate

In addition to generating an entire project, the nest generate command can also generate other types of code, such as controllers, services, and modules.

For example, to generate a module:

```bash
nest generate module module-name
```

It will generate the module's code:

![nest generate module](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/6.png)

And automatically import it into the AppModule:

![app module](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/7.png)

Similarly, you can generate controllers and services:

```bash
nest generate controller controller-name

nest generate service service-name

```

![nest generate controller](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/8.png)

![nest generate service](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/9.png)

It will also update the module's dependencies.

![user module](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/10.png)

Of course, if you want to generate a complete module's code without doing it one by one, you can use:

```
nest generate resource resource-name
```

It will prompt you to choose which type of code to generate because Nest supports HTTP, WebSocket, GraphQL, TCP, etc. Here, we choose HTTP for RESTful API:

![nest generate resource](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/11.png)

Then let you choose whether to generate CRUD code:


![nest generate resource](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/12.png)

After selecting "Yes," the entire module's CRUD + REST API code will be generated:

![nest generate resource](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/13.png)

Of course, it will also automatically import it into the AppModule:

![app module](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/14.png)

![product controller](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/15.png)

This is how nest generate works, enabling quick generation of various types of code:

![nest generate -h](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/16.png)

These code templates are defined in the @nestjs/schematics package.

When creating a project with nest new, there's an option --collection for configuring this. However, we typically don't need to configure it.

You can see the definitions of these code templates in @nestjs/schematics:

![nestjs schematics](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/17.png)

Its implementation is straightforward; it uses a template engine to fill in variables and prints out the code:

![nestjs schematics](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/18.png)

nest generate also comes with several options:

-  --flat and --no-flat specify whether to generate corresponding directories.

- --spec and --no-spec specify whether to generate test files.

- --skip-import specifies not to import into the AppModule.

As for --project, it specifies which sub-project the generated code is for. We'll discuss this when we use it in a monorepo project later.

This is the powerful capability provided by Nest CLI for quickly generating various types of code. Isn't it convenient?

### Building Your Project：nest build

Next up is nest build, which is used to build the project. Executing nest build will generate compiled code in the dist directory.

Similarly, it comes with some options:

![nest build -h](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/19.png)

- --webpack and --tsc specify which compiler to use. By default, it's tsc, but you can switch to webpack.

Here's the output of tsc compilation:

![nest build](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/20.png)

And here's the output of webpack compilation:

![nest build --webpack](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/21.png)

tsc doesn't bundle, while webpack does. Both methods are viable.

- --watch listens for file changes and automatically builds. By default, it only watches .ts and .js files. Adding --watchAssets will also watch other files like .md, .yml, etc., and output them to the dist directory.
- --path specifies the path to the tsc configuration file.

Now, what about --config?

It's for specifying a configuration file, but not for your project. It's for Nest CLI's configuration file.

### Configuration with nest-cli.json

All the options we mentioned earlier can be configured in nest-cli.json:

![nest build --webpack](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/22.png)

For example, setting webpack to true in compilerOptions is equivalent to nest build --webpack:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/nest-cli",
  "collection": "@nestjs/schematics",
  "sourceRoot": "src",
  "generateOptions": {
    "spec": false,
    "flat": false
  },
  "compilerOptions": {
    "deleteOutDir": true,
    "webpack": true,
    "watchAssets": false,
    "assets": [
      "**/*.css"
    ]
  }
}
```

Setting webpack to false uses tsc.

Setting deleteOutDir to true clears the dist directory every time you build.

assets specifies which non .js and .ts files to copy to the dist directory during nest build.

You can use include and exclude for precise matching and specify whether to watchAssets separately.

However, it only supports copying files from the src directory. If they're outside src, you'll need to write your own script.

Next is generateOptions, which has the same effect as --no-spec and --no-flat when using nest generate.

sourceRoot specifies the source code directory.

entryFile specifies the entry file name, defaulting to main.

$schema specifies the schema for nest-cli.json. You can see which properties it can have here:

> https://json.schemastore.org/nest-cli

It's a pretty straightforward JSON schema, If you want to fully understand what properties nest-cli.json can have, take a look at this schema definition.

### Running Your Application: nest start

Next, let's take a look at the nest start command:

![nest start](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/23.png)

You can see that it rebuilds every time and runs main.js with Node.

It has the following options:

![nest start -h](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/24.png)

- --watch is the most commonly used option, automatically rebuilding when files are changed.
- --debug starts a debugging WebSocket service for debugging.
- --exec specifies which runtime to use. By default, it's Node, but you can switch to another runtime.

The rest of the options are the same as nest build, so I won't repeat them.

### Viewing Project Information: nest info

Lastly, there's the nest info command, which is used to view project information, including system information, Node.js, npm, and dependency versions:

![nest start -h](/stories/nestjs/mastering-nestjs-cli/25.png)

### Summary

Nest provides the nest command in the @nestjs/cli package, which can be used for various tasks:
- Generating project structures and various types of code
- Compiling code
- Automatically compiling code when files change
- Printing project dependency information

These are the subcommands available:
- nest new: Quickly create a project
- nest generate: Quickly generate various types of code
- nest build: Build code using tsc or webpack
- nest start: Start the development server, supports watching and debugging
- nest info: Print dependency versions of Node.js, npm, and Nest packages

Many options can be configured in nest-cli.json, such as generateOptions, compilerOptions, etc.
